# Info

In this repo I will put all my projects made during my FreeCodeCamp experience. I will include the source code and some description about projects.
I will appreciate any hint for bug fix or for some improvments.

##### Random Quote Generator
You can view the final result [here](https://mark3z.github.io/ffc_projects/random_quote_generator/main.html).
I used API from [forismatic](http://forismatic.com/en/api/) to generate random quotes. Sometimes it may not work well because some browsers block _mixed content active_ from this forismatic's API. To resolve that you can change the http protocol from 'https' to 'http'.


#### Local Weather App
You can find the app at this [link](http://codepen.io/mark3z/pen/OWQZpV/).
I used API from [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/) to display climatical conditions in the user's position, API gives all weather data displayed and weather's icons. The browser find user's location using HTML geolocation API.
Sometimes it may not work well because some browsers block _mixed content active_ from this OpenWeather's API. To resolve that you can change the http protocol from 'https' to 'http'.



#### Wikipedia Search
The project is at this [link](https://mark3z.github.io/ffc_projects/wikipedia_search/main.html).
The user can type what he/she wants to look for and click the button, or hit enter, and it will display five articles (article's heading, description and a link) from Wikipedia. Instead if the user clicks on link 'click here for a random search', it will display a random article.
FreeCodeCamp gave us the API for the random search. I used the API for [opensearch action](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=help&modules=opensearch).


#### Twitch TV JSON API
The project is at this [link](https://mark3z.github.io/ffc_projects/twitch_tv/main.html). I used the API and jQuery to display some Twitch's channels, their status and if they are streaming or not.
