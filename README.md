# Info

In this repo I will put all my projects made during my FreeCodeCamp experience. I will include the sourse code and some description about projects.

##### Random Quote Generator
You can view the final result [here](https://mark3z.github.io/ffc_projects/random_quote_generator/main.html).
I used API from [forismatic](http://forismatic.com/en/api/) to generate random quotes. Sometimes it doesn't work well, but if you turn your browser from https to http it works in a proper way. I will appreciate any hint for bug fix or for some improvments.
