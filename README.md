# Info

In this repo I will put all my projects made during my FreeCodeCamp experience. I will include the sourse code and some description about projects.

##### Random Quote Generator
You can view the final result [here](http://mark3z.github.io/ffc_projects/random_quote_generator/main.html).
I used API from [forismatic](http://forismatic.com/en/api/) to generate random quotes. Sometimes it may not work well because some browsers block _mixed content active_ from this forismatic's API. To resolve that you can change the http protocol from 'https' to 'http'. I will appreciate any hint for bug fix or for some improvments.


#### Local Weather App
You can find the app at this [link](http://mark3z.github.io/ffc_projects/local_weather/main.html).
I used API from [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/) to display climatical conditions in the user's position, API gives all weather data displayed and weather's icons. The browser find user's location using HTML geolocation API.
Sometimes it may not work well because some browsers block _mixed content active_ from this OpenWeather's API. To resolve that you can change the http protocol from 'https' to 'http'.
I will appreciate any hint for bug fix or for some improvments.
